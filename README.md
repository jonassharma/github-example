About us
United Utilities is responsible for water and wastewater services in the North West of England. Our purpose is to provide great service to customers and communities in the North West, creating long-term value for all of our stakeholders.
We deliver 200 million litres of water a day to more than 3 million homes and businesses in the North West, as well as treating all the wastewater which disappears around the U-bend.
Keeping the region flowing relies on a vast behind the scenes operation, involving hundreds of reservoirs, treatment works and pumping stations; thousands of kilometres of water pipes and sewers and a 5,000 strong workforce.
